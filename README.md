# angular-web-survey
An angular app that display a web page for a survey.

Uses material design components for the UI.

This was done as a sample project for an interview, but I'm gonna make it public at this point since I took time to make it.
There was supposed to be a login and signup screen at first, didn't get around to those in time.
The survey portion should be complete minus a service call to a would-be API app, though.

# Running
See package.json for dependencies. It should be pretty minimal but requires Node and Angular CLI installed.

For installing Angular CLI if you have Node/NPM, you can run 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

If that doesn't work, you can follow some of the setup documentation for Angular: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

Run 'npm install' from command line to get project dependencies.

Run 'ng serve' to compile and run the code. Page will be hosted at localhost:4200
